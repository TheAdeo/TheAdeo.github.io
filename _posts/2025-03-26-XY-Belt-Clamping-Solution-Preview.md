# XY-Belt Clamping Solution - Preview

The Monolith's flipped belt path is one belt's thickness away from the X MGN12H carriage's surface. Therefore, it's possible to design a thin SLM belt clamp around the carriage with the following design goals:
- Single-piece
- Very light and space-efficient compared to other solutions
- Achieve the minimum 6T count recommended by Gates (no damage to the belt teeth at spec tension and high accels)
- The belt section under load is completely straight (no minimum bending radius violation)
- Narrow enough to achieve the standard X-travels (250, 300, 350)
- Can clip onto the carriage without screws until the rest of the toolhead is installed
- No vertical space constraint (universal, supports belts up to 12mm)
- Excess belt on the outside
- With only 2 screws partially tightened it's easy to pull the belt's other end to take out all the slack before tensioning

I'm considering making a standalone version of this available to help with toolhead development/conversion for the belt path. Even if the rest of the toolhead carriage is plastic, this can be a robust solution.
